# Terminals and Shell programs

### Learning Goals
- What is the terminal program?
- What is a shell program? (Bash, zsh, fish)
- How do the two work together?
- How configuration files work (.bashrc, .zshrc, .vimrc)
- What are shell environment variables ($USER, $PATH)
- What does adding to the PATH mean, and how is it done, and why is it useful?

### The Terminal

The terminal is the entry point to our demo. The terminal provides an application space for us to be able to
interact with out computer. The terminal's job is to load and run a shell program, like one of the several
listed above (zsh, bash, fish). These shell programs are called shells, because they 'wrap around' the terminal
in a way, allowing us to interact with the terminal. Before we had our fancy graphical user interface (GUI)
computers, everyone that wanted to use a computer was forced to use the terminal, or command line. Now that we
regularly use the mouse, shell programs aren't nearly as commonly used as they once were. As a software
developer, you will find the terminal to be the most effective way to write programs and develop software.

### Shell Programs

A shell program provides all of the functionality you are used to while using the terminal. This program,
at its most basic level, provides a prompt for the user to input commands, and each one is processed as it
is received. The command from the user could be a program, like `ls` or `cd`. Both of these 'commands' are 
actually programs that we call upon to do their jobs.
